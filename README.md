Carbon Tracker MVC

Carbon Tracker MVC is a web-based application built using ASP.NET MVC that helps users track and monitor their daily carbon footprint. 
The system allows users to log activities, calculate estimated carbon emissions, and visualize their environmental impact over time.
How It Works

Users enter daily activities such as transportation or electricity usage. The system calculates estimated carbon emissions based on predefined emission factors and stores the data for tracking and analysis.
